He’ll explain how to connect your cloud infrastructure to on-premise to get the most out of a hybrid cloud solution. In this session, you’ll learn how to:

AWS virtual private cloud basics
Configure subnets, route tables, and NAT instances
Deploy virtual machine instances
Prep an RDSH or workstation for auto-scaling
Session Takeaway: Network engineers who are used to working on-premise will learn how to architect and deploy a network with machines in the Amazon AWS cloud and gain the necessary knowledge to move their workload to the cloud.
